        Here the user will be able to set a budget for something. Buying a
        house, TV, computer vacation, etc. User will be able to set a part of a
        transaction towards this budget. Let's say I have a 1000 dolar
        transaction to my savings, and I want to set apart 300 for vacation and
        the rest for emergency fund.
